[Jones*](http://indestructible-type.github.io/Jones.html)
========

Jones* is based off of the work of Tobias Frere-Jones. This font is a modification and extention of [Montserrat](https://github.com/impallari/Libre-Bodoni). This font is licensed under the [SIL opend type license](http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=OFL).

Jones is going through a bit of a renovation process right now. There are a lot of issues that resulted from trying to expand Montserrat, and to try and circumvent that it would be best to redesign it from scratch.
